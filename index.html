            1. <u> Six  of crows --</u>
            <br>
            Six of Crows is the new book by Leigh Bardugo, author of the Grisha Trilogy. It is still set in the same world as the Grisha trilogy, but on a different continent and with completely new characters.
            Six of Crows is the story of Kaz Brekker and his crew, attempting to pull off an impossible heist. There is Kaz, known as ‘Dirtyhands’ in the Barrel (the slums of Ketterdam), who is part of The Dregs. The Dregs is a gang, and as the name suggests consists of everyone scraped from the floor of the Barrel. Then there is Inej, the wraith, whose ability to move soundlessly makes her unique. Jesper, a sharpshooter with a serious gambling problem and Wylan, the insurance. Finally Nina, a grisha heartrender and Matthias, the outsider with insider knowledge. Together, they are going on a suicide mission, and together they are dangerous enough to have a chance.
            Six of Crows
            I loved Bardugo’s Grisha Trilogy and couldn’t wait to read Six of Crows – I certainly wasn’t disappointed. I loved the setting of the Barrel, which made the book intriguing and exciting from the start. Bardugo perfectly captures the essence of the criminal underworld of Ketterdam. I will never not be amazed by the depth of her world building, with occasional hints to the characters of the Grisha trilogy. The characters are also carefully and brilliantly crafted, with each of them bringing something essential to the story and having their own problems to work out. There was never a dull moment, with constant twists and turns and I can’t wait to read the next book in the series!

            2. <u>Crooked kingdom--</u>
            <br>
            Welcome to the world of the Grisha.
            Kaz Brekker and his crew of deadly outcasts have just pulled off a heist so daring even they didn't think they'd survive. But instead of divvying up a fat reward, they're right back to fighting for their lives.
            Double-crossed and badly weakened, the crew is low on resources, allies, and hope. As powerful forces from around the world descend on Ketterdam to root out the secrets of the dangerous drug known as jurda parem, old rivals and new enemies emerge to challenge Kaz's cunning and test the team's fragile loyalties.
            A war will be waged on the city's dark and twisting streets - a battle for revenge and redemption that will decide the fate of the Grisha world
